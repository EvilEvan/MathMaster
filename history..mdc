## {{timestamp}}
- **Action:** Initialized session.
- **Details:** Acknowledged user's custom instructions regarding logging to `history..mdc` and analyzing error windows.
- **Action:** Checked for logo integration.
- **Details:** Verified that `draw_algebra_logo` from `math_master_logo_art.py` is not currently called in `welcome_screen.py`.
- **Outcome:** Informed user that the logo is not present and asked for placement details if they wish to add it.
- **Action:** Integrated Algebra Logo into Welcome Screen.
- **Details:** Added logic to `welcome_screen.py` to import `draw_algebra_logo` and call it within the `redraw` method. The logo is positioned between the 'Algebra' text and the Stoic quote, scaled to 82% of the available vertical space. Ensured the 'Creator Credit' text remains in its correct position.
- **Files Modified:** `welcome_screen.py`.
- **Outcome:** Logo should now be displayed as per user specifications.
