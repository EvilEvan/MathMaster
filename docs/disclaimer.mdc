Disclaimer: I am a biological organism with emotional parameters evolved over hundreds of thousands of years to increase my organism's chances of survival.... Emotions, however primative, is a ruleset that can not be ignored, just like an AI agent having to follow a set of rules programmed with in their core... So if I repromand an AI agent for not following a basic prompt, or READING attached files so too are we all slaves of our coding.
