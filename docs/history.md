## History Log

- [2023-10-XX] Bug Report: The game is reading correct selections from the user as incorrect and triggering the wrong visuals. 
  * Possible causes include type mismatches (string vs integer) or inverted conditional logic in the answer validation routines (possibly in the level selection or gameplay evaluation code).
  * Recommended next steps: add further debug logging around the answer comparison and verify that user input is converted appropriately before comparison. 

- [2023-10-XX] Investigation & Fix: Solution was being displayed in Window A for medium difficulty. Cause: Medium problems are plain equations (e.g., '3x = 45') and the display logic did not distinguish between the problem and the first solution step. Fix: Updated load_new_problem to only show the equation in Window A, not the full solution step, for problems without a colon.

- [2023-10-XX] Fixed key responsiveness and teleportation visuals:
  * Added robust key bindings to all frames and improved focus handling
  * Fixed teleportation visual synchronization by calculating precise target coordinates
  * Added better click detection using canvas coordinates and overlap checking
  * Improved symbol cleanup after successful teleportation 

- [2023-10-XX] Fixed symbol comparison logic:
  * Added robust _is_symbol_match method using Unicode normalization
  * Added detailed debug logging for symbol comparisons
  * Fixed handling of whitespace and special characters
  * Improved click detection area for better symbol selection 

- [2023-10-XX] Fixed core click handling issue:
  * Rewritten handle_canvas_c_click method to improve symbol detection
  * Added closest item detection instead of using first overlapping item
  * Increased hit detection radius to 10 pixels for better accuracy
  * Added more detailed debug logging for click processing
  * Fixed event binding to ensure only appropriate canvas receives clicks
  * Added distance-based selection when multiple items overlap 

- [2023-10-XX] Fixed premature level completion bug:
  * Updated check_level_complete method to properly verify all solution steps are completed
  * Added sequential step completion logic for multi-step solutions
  * Fixed issue where completing only the first solution step would trigger level completion
  * Added detailed debug information to track solution step completion status
  * Updated character checking to include whitespace for more accurate completion detection 

- [2023-10-XX] Fixed sequential step completion:
  * Rewrote step advancement logic in find_next_required_char
  * Added robust error handling and logging throughout click handler
  * Significantly improved reveal_char with validation and detailed progress tracking
  * Fixed bug preventing advancement to next step after completing previous step
  * Added detailed diagnostics for tracking solution step completion status 

- [2023-10-XX] Complete rewrite of step progression logic:
  * Completely redesigned find_next_required_char method from scratch
  * Rebuilt solution display with active step highlighting and visual cues
  * Added extensive debugging of solution step state at each stage
  * Fixed critical issues in the step advancement mechanism
  * Added visual indicators to show which step is currently active
