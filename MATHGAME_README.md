# MathMistress - Greek Mathematical Wisdom

**A masterclass HTML/JavaScript mathematical conversion game with Greek philosophical themes**

## 🏛️ Game Overview

MathMistress is an innovative educational game that combines mathematical problem-solving with Greek philosophical wisdom and distracting mythological characters. The game follows the principle that **the player must request help rather than expect it**, encouraging self-discovery and neural network development through practice.

### 🎯 Core Features

- **Greek Philosophical Theme**: Inspired by ancient Greek mathematics with elements of Dionysus and Quetzalcoatl
- **Interactive Characters**: Dionysus and Quetzalcoatl attempt to break the player's focus
- **Help-on-Request System**: The "ΒΟΗΘΕΙΑ" (Help) button shows the next step, not explanations
- **No Saving/Storing**: Pure session-based gameplay for focused learning
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Six levels from Novice to Master
- **Beautiful UI**: Modern design with Greek typography and marble aesthetics

## 🎮 Gameplay Mechanics

### Problem Solving
- Click individual characters in the solution steps to reveal them
- Each problem has step-by-step solutions that must be uncovered sequentially
- The goal is to understand the mathematical process, not just find answers

### Character Distractions
- **Dionysus** (🍷): Represents temptation and celebration, trying to lure players away from study
- **Quetzalcoatl** (🐍): Represents shortcuts and easy solutions, discouraging hard work

### Help System
The game's unique feature is the help button that:
- Shows the NEXT character to click, not explanations
- Encourages pattern recognition
- Builds neural pathways through repetition
- Only provides guidance when explicitly requested

### Level Progression
1. **Novice**: Basic addition/subtraction (numbers 1-20)
2. **Apprentice**: Extended problems (numbers 1-50)  
3. **Disciple**: Including multiplication (numbers 1-100)
4. **Scholar**: More complex operations (numbers 1-200)
5. **Sage**: Advanced problems (numbers 1-500)
6. **Master**: Expert level (numbers 1-1000)

## 🚀 How to Play

1. **Open the Game**: Launch `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. **Read the Problem**: Equation appears in the marble container
3. **Solve Step-by-Step**: Click characters in the solution area to reveal them
4. **Request Help**: Click "ΒΟΗΘΕΙΑ" when stuck (shows next character)
5. **Avoid Distractions**: Don't click on Dionysus or Quetzalcoatl
6. **Progress**: Complete 3 problems to advance to the next level

}
```

### Creating New Characters
```javascript
// In characters.js, extend characterData
newCharacter: {
    name: 'NewCharacter',
    distractions: ['Custom message...'],
    movements: [{ type: 'custom', amplitude: 20 }]
}
```
